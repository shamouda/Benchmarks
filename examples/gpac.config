%% This configuration is intened to benchmark the Generalized Paxos Atomic Commit (GPAC) protocol, developed by Maiyya et al. 2019 (VLDB 2019).
%% The important parameters are as follows:

%% {concurrent, number} number of concurrent threads
%% this has to be carefully chosen. Too few threads will
%% not exploit the real throughput of the system, while too high concurrency will over-stress
%% the system and trigger timeouts. The suggested number is about 20.
{concurrent, 10}.
%% {mode, max|{rate, integer()}}: how often a thread should send request. Use 'max' for benchmarking.
%% If you are debugging, maybe {rate, N} can be useful, which means each thread sends N reqs per second.
{mode, max}.

%% Duration, in minutes, of the test.
{duration, 1}.

%% the benchmark driver, the source file that contains the operations to be issued.
{driver, basho_bench_driver_gpac}.

%{key_generator, {dc_bias, 1, 1, 1, 1000}}.
{key_generator, {pareto_int, 1000000}}.

%%{value_generator, {uniform_int, 100}}.
{value_generator, {fixed_bin, 10}}.

{operations, [{sim2pc, 1}]}.
